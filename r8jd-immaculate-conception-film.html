I've liked some of the ST content, and I've been unsure about a fair amount of it. Perhaps once I've seen Ep.9 that uncertainty will have solidified, one way or the other. But this is what I think so far: I've seen a lot of references to the idea that flip-flopping directors/writers from film to film within the ST has created an inconsistent mess. But I think those people are taking the films too liter.

STAR WARS PREQUEL REVISION OVERVIEW My Prequel Vision: Episode I: Attack Of The Clones Episode II: The Phantom Menace Episode III: The Shadow of the Empire PREFACE : I’m a big fan of Darth Vader, and the idea of Darth Vader’s arc. I’ve always been a little bitter at the way his story was handled in the prequels.

Was Mary sinless? Why do Roman Catholics believe in the Immaculate Conception With even a cursory viewing it becomes clear that the realms of the Star Wars galaxy are nasty, brutish, and contain injustices that many would probably find very distasteful.
